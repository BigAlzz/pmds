# Separation Rules

- **Single Responsibility:**  
  Each file should represent one distinct unit of work.

- **Component Breakdown:**  
  Break features into self-contained components.

- **Use Hooks:**  
  Encapsulate logic and data access in custom hooks.

- **Global vs. Local:**  
  - **Global:** Place reusable components and hooks in shared/global folders.  
  - **Local:** Keep object-specific components and hooks in localized folders.

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  Maintain clear boundaries when creating or refactoring files.

- **Readable and Declarative Code:**  
  Rendered code should be very legible and clear. It should not include flow logic or ternary operators where possible.
